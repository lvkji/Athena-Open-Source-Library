# üìö Athena LMS

**Athena** is a user-friendly online platform designed to allow students, authors, and administrators to share and access non-copyrighted academic materials such as books, articles, and open-source documents. The system is intended to fill educational gaps by creating a free and reliable resource hub for verified, high-quality content contributed by the academic community.

Athena features a role-based architecture supporting three user types: Students can upload and browse materials, bookmark resources, filter by subject or verification status, and provide ratings and feedback. Authors are empowered to upload, categorize, and verify academic materials, ensuring content relevance and accuracy. Administrators manage user permissions, moderate uploads, and enforce platform quality standards.

The system supports long-term academic growth by preserving uploads across semesters and offering features like content filtering, sorting, and verification by trusted contributors. Planned future enhancements include personalized content recommendations using machine learning, collaborative annotation tools, discussion forums tied to each resource, gamified engagement metrics, and integration with popular learning management systems such as Canvas and Blackboard.

Athena is built using a full LAMP stack: a PHP backend, MariaDB database, and HTML/CSS (Tailwind) frontend. It is designed for scalability, security, and usability, ensuring 24/7 access, robust database performance, and privacy-aware handling of user data. Athena will continue to grow as an open-access educational library shaped by student needs and academic expertise.
